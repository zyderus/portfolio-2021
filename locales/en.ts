    'Hi! I am Rustam and I enjoy creating attractive, human-friendly apps that brighten up the day. My interest in application development started back in 1998. Then, as a student, I grokked HTML and CGI scripts to built a personal web page with a guestbook. It was hideous, but somehow functional. However, in the following few years, my career path had not steered towards the code. I went from business consulting to artist management, construction recruiting, logistics. Fast-forward to 2018, and out of nowhere, I have an encounter with Arduino with its idea of C++. My head made a few blips and clicks and the rest is history.',
